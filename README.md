# Python Basics: Building a Calculator, Understanding Operators, and Student Marks Ranking System




## Overview

This project covers two primary objectives:

Python Basics: Building a simple calculator and demonstrating various operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.) in Python. This serves as a guide for beginners to understand how operators work, along with practical examples using Python's built-in functions and operator precedence.
Student Marks Calculator and Ranking System: A basic program to compute total marks, average, and percentage for six subjects. It also identifies the highest and second-highest scorer from a predefined list of students.
## Key Features

* Simple Calculator: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* Operators in Python: Demonstrations of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators with practical examples.

* Marks Calculation: Allows user input of marks for six subjects and calculates total, average, and percentage.

* Ranking System: Identifies and displays the top two students based on their scores.
## Technology Used

* Python 3.x: The primary programming language used throughout the project.

* Jupyter Notebook: For writing and running code interactively.
## Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [repository-link]

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd [project-directory]

3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or later). You can download it from the official Python website.

4. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip if you don't already have it:
pip install notebook
    
## Run

## Python Basics: Calculator and Operators
1. Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
jupyter notebook

3. Open the relevant notebooks:
Demo - Building a Simple Calculator.ipynb
Demo - Operators in Python.ipynb

4. Execute the cells interactively to explore the examples and code demonstrations.

## Student Marks Calculator and Ranking System
1. Open the notebook:
* DIY2.ipynb

2. Run the notebook cells to:
* Input marks for six subjects and calculate total, average, and percentage.
* Display the highest and second-highest scorer based on predefined scores.
## Conclusion

This combined project serves as both an introductory guide to Python operators and a practical tool for student marks calculation and ranking. It offers a foundation for beginners to understand basic programming concepts in Python while performing real-world tasks like scoring and ranking. Future improvements could include:

Extending the calculator with more complex operations.
Adding graphical representations of scores using libraries like Matplotlib.
Expanding on other Python concepts, such as handling input from files or databases.
